# Steps to go live with a public app

Thank you for your decision to build an app for Ecwid!

Follow the steps listed below to convert your app idea into a working solution available to more than 100M users around the world.

### Submit your app idea

Send a [Request form](https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-market-request) telling us about the app you want to create: how it will help our merchants, what regions it should work in, does it work on other e-commerce platforms, etc.

### Learn more about application types

Public apps can have different business logic or none at all. Depending on what backend and/or website admin you have, we offer two main approaches to handling your users known as **application types.**

Two types are Native and External apps. With a suitable type, you can make the most user-friendly application.

Read more about [Native vs. External applications](native-and-external-apps/).

### Learn more about monetizing

When you build for Ecwid App Market, you access thousands of potential users for the app. There are many ways to monetize your work: monthly price, pay-per-use payments, one-time premium purchases, and more. Ecwid has everything to set up and handle the flexible billing for you.

Read more about [monetizing your app](monetize-public-apps.md).

### Start working on a dev version

Once your [Request form](https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-market-request) is approved, we will give you a free test store on a Premium plan and a dev app. With this setup, you can access all Ecwid features and use the store as a playground.

[Email us](mailto:ec.apps@lightspeedhq.com) if your workflow requires an additional staging app or several stores for tests.

### Complete app publishing process

Now you have the dev version ready to be released, find the **Readiness form** link in your email (the one you specified for the dev app) and submit it to start the technical review and publishing process.

Before starting the review, we create a new app (prod version) and add technical settings, marketing texts, and images for the App Market card to this app. Once the review is done, we publish your app in App Market and provide you with the monthly reports document if you use our billing.
