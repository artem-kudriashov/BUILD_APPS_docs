# Guide to App Validation

To make your application publicly available in the Ecwid App Market, you must complete its technical verification with the App Market team. Completing the verification process ensures that your app is secure, user-friendly, and meets our quality standards.

We recommend following these steps to pass the app review as fast as possible:

1. Go through the **Validation checklist** that covers all technical requirements for Ecwid App Market apps: [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17vtfnvtiE_1OsfGFatCxK8RhOCqJmWaw3v_2pd5YI7c/edit?gid=1360471883#gid=1360471883)\
   \
   Make sure that your application meets all the requirements listed there. If not, the app won't pass the verification.\
   \
   Contact API Support team if you need any help with this step: [ec.apps@lightspeedhq.com](mailto:ec.apps@lightspeedhq.com)
2. Submit the **App Readiness Form**. You'll find a link to the form in the initial email received from the App Market team.\
   \
   Our team will review your submission in **3 business days**, and then follow up with any questions and the production version of your app. It's not yet publically available, however this version is used to get through the validation process.
3. Once the prod app is set up and works, record a **high-quality video demonstration** showcasing all aspects of your application: usability, speed, security, data handling, etc. To cover all essentials, follow our Guide to recording validation screencast: [guide-to-recording-app-validation-screencast.md](guide-to-recording-app-validation-screencast.md "mention")\
   \
   Then send this recording to App Market team.
4. That's it, congrats!\
   \
   When the app validation is passed, the app goes live without further ado and becomes available to thousands of our users in the App Market. Our team will additionally notify you when it happens.
