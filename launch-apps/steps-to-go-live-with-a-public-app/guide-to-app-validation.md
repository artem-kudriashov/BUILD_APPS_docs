# Guide to App Validation

To make your application publicly available in the Ecwid App Market, you must complete its technical verification with the App Market team. Completing the verification process ensures that your app is secure, user-friendly, and meets our quality standards.

We recommend following these steps to pass the app review as fast as possible:

1. Go through the **Validation checklist** that covers all technical requirements for Ecwid App Market apps: [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17vtfnvtiE_1OsfGFatCxK8RhOCqJmWaw3v_2pd5YI7c/edit?gid=1360471883#gid=1360471883)\
   \
   Make sure that your application meets all the requirements listed there. If not, the app won't pass the verification.\
   \
   Contact API Support team if you need any help with this step: [ec.apps@lightspeedhq.com](mailto:ec.apps@lightspeedhq.com)
2. Prepare your submission by recording a **high-quality video demonstration** showcasing all aspects of your application: usability, speed, security, data handling, etc.\
   \
   To cover all essentials, follow our Guide to recording validation screencast: [guide-to-recording-app-validation-screencast.md](guide-to-recording-app-validation-screencast.md "mention")
3. Submit the App Readiness Form with a link to the validation screencast. You'll find a link to the form in the initial email received from the App Market team.\
   \
   Our team will review your submission and follow up with any questions or provide a straight approval to your specified email.\
   \
   ETA for the follow-up email is **3 business days**.
4. That's it!\
   \
   When the app review is passed, the app goes live without further ado and becomes available to thousands of our users in the App Market.
