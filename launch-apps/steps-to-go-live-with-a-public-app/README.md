# Steps to go live with a public app

Thank you for your decision to build an app for Ecwid!

Follow the steps listed below to convert your app idea into a working solution available to more than 100M users around the world.

### Submit your app idea

Send a [Request form](https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-market-request) telling us about the app you want to create: its usefulness to our merchants, preferred billing type, supported regions and platforms, etc.

### Learn more about application types

Public apps can have different business logic or none at all. Depending on what backend and/or website admin you have, we offer two main approaches to handling your users, known as **application types.**

Two types are **Native** and **External** apps. Choose a suitable type for your app to make a secure and reliable application for our mutual users: [native-and-external-apps](../native-and-external-apps/ "mention")

### Learn more about monetizing

With an app in our App Market, you gain access to thousands of potential paid users.&#x20;

There are many ways to monetize your work: monthly price, pay-per-use payments, one-time premium purchases, and more. Ecwid provides tools to set up and handle flexible billing: [monetize-public-apps.md](../monetize-public-apps.md "mention")

### Start working on a dev version

With an approved [Request form](https://portal.ecwid.com/en-us/app-market-request), you get a free test store on a Premium plan and a dev app. From here, you can access all platform features and freely use the store as a playground.

[Email us](mailto:ec.apps@lightspeedhq.com) if your workflow requires an additional staging app or several stores for tests.

### Complete app publishing process

When your app is ready to be published, start the **app validation** process to ensure it meets all requirements. At its end, the app gets published and becomes available in the Ecwid App Market.

To get through the validation process more easily, follow the [guide-to-app-validation.md](guide-to-app-validation.md "mention")
