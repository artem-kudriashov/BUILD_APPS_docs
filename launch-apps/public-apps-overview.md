# Public apps overview

**Public applications** can give our clients additional customization tools or add new integrations to their stores. Any custom app can become public. Any developer can come to us and create a public app. We always welcome new additions to our [App Market](https://www.ecwid.com/apps)!

**App Market** is a place where clients can search and install public apps in their stores. It has a search tool, collections, and categories to make it easier to find specific apps.

We have an automated flow where you start with only an idea of an app and end up with it being published in the App Market.&#x20;

Start with the dev version of your app in the free dev environment and test it with us before publishing the app.
