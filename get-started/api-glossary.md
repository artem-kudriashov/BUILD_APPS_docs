#### Custom app

Private application for accessing Ecwid API in a specific store. Ecwid creates one custom app for any user who visits the app dashboard in Ecwid admin for the first time.

#### App dashboard

#### Access scope

#### API keys

Unchangeable and unique credentials for app authentication and decoding some API requests.&#x20;

Every application has two API keys: `client_id` (app ID) and `client_secret` (app secret).

#### App ID

An app key used to identify the particular application. For public apps, the app ID often matches with the app name. In API, we refer to this ID as the appâ€™s `client_id`.

#### App secret

Unique authentication key of an app that must be kept hidden and secure as it grants access to app authentication. In documentation, reffered as `client_secret`.

#### Access tokens

Secure app credentials for authorizing REST API requests. If an app is installed in several Ecwid stores, it has unique access tokens for every store. \
\
There are two tokens:  `secret_token` and `public_token`. Learn more about app access tokens: [app-settings.md](../develop-apps/app-settings.md "mention")

#### App endpoint

Link to a self-hosted server URL connected to the app that enables a specific feature. For example, the `paymentUrl` endpoint allows you to receive online payment requests from your store through the app.
